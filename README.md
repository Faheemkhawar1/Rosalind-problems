# Rosalind-problem

This repository contains solutions to several problems from the Rosalind bioinformatics platform. Each solution is implemented as a Python script and requires a corresponding input file located in the same directory as the script. Before running any of the scripts, ensure that the input file is in the same repository.

Problem 1: Count DNA Bases  
Script: `count_dna_bases.py`  
Input File:rosalind_dna.txt  
 This script calculates the frequency of each base (A, C, G, T) in a given DNA sequence.

Problem 2:DNA to RNA
Script: `dna_to_rna.py`  
Input File: rosalind_rna.txt`  
This script transcribes a DNA sequence into its corresponding RNA sequence by replacing all occurrences of 'T' with 'U'.

Problem 3: Reverse Complement  
Script:  reverse_complement.py`  
Input File: `rosalind_revc.txt`  
This script generates the reverse complement of a given DNA sequence.

Problem 4: Fibonacci Sequence  
Script: `fibonacci.py`  
Input File: `rosalind_fib.txt`  
This script calculates the number of rabbit pairs after a given number of months, based on the Fibonacci recurrence relation.

Problem 5: GC Content  
Script: `GC_Content.py`  
Input File: `rosalind_gc.txt`  
 This script calculates the GC-content of a DNA string, which is the percentage of 'C' and 'G' bases in the string.
